# DGPF-RENet
DGPF-RENet: A new architecture with low data dependence and fast convergence for hyperspectral image classification

Now we have released the core code algorithm, and the complete project code will be released in the future.

Because we have added the activation function swish that is not available in the keras library, please add the function in keras.activation.py.
