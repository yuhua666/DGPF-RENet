# DGPF-RENet
DGPF-RENet: A new architecture with low data dependence and fast convergence for hyperspectral image classification (Submitted to TGRS)

Now we have released the core code algorithm, and the complete project will be open source when the paper is accepted.

Because we have added the activation function swish that is not available in the keras library, please add the function in keras.activation.py.
